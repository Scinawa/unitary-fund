Thanks for contributing a blog post to the UF site!

Some quick tips:
- Use the `title` field to set the title of your post, no first level header needed.
- Standard markdown formatting is supported (code blocks, links, images, etc.)
  - Put images for your post in the `images` folder.
- If you need further custom formatting, direct html will work here as well.
